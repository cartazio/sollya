	* tests-tool/Makefile.am, tests-tool/check031.sollya,
	tests-tool/check031.sollya.reference: Removed non-regression test
	for the bug fixed at commit 9b578b8.  It seems really not easy to do a robust test that would also work on
	platforms without an X server.

2016-09-13  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	* tests-tool/check029.sollya, tests-tool/check029.sollya.reference: 
	Added additional checks for min and max.

2016-09-13  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	* execute.c: Patching a bug with infinities in min and max.

2016-09-13  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	* tests-tool/check031.sollya: Some improvements to check031, making
	it run when no X is available and improving locking behavior.

2016-09-12  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* tests-tool/Makefile.am, tests-tool/check031.sollya,
	tests-tool/check031.sollya.reference: Kind of non regression test
	for the bug patched with commit f175f2b.

2016-09-12  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* tests-tool/timecheck.sollya,
	tests-tool/timecheck.sollya.reference: Non-regression test for a
	performance bug addressed at commit e0b3184.  The test currently does not pass as the performance issue seems to
	still exist, although it has been already much improved by commit
	e0b3184.

2016-09-12  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* remez.c: Patched a memory leak in remez

2016-09-09  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* tests-tool/check030.sollya, tests-tool/check030.sollya.reference: 
	Added non-regression tests for bugs #12892 and (parts of) #17200.

2016-09-09  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* remez.c, sollya-messages.h, sollya-messaging.h: Kind of patched
	bug #12892.  The patch is not perfect, but works and will work in most
	situations, although this is not the smartest thing we could do. The
	problem was that multi-point exchange algorithm sometimes behaves
	badly when Haar condition is not fulfilled, leading to a situation
	where epsilon could suddenly decrease (instead of constantly
	increase), therefore leading to possible pseudo-cycles in the
	algorithm.  When we detect that epsilon has decreased, we now simply switch to
	the single point exchange algorithm and keep this choice active
	until the end of the algorithm. This ensures that no cycle can
	happen.  We could do better by starting over from the previous set of points
	(instead of simply continuing with the set of points that led to
	epsilon decreasing) but the patch to do it would be more involved,
	and in practice it does not seem to be very harmful to simply
	continue the algorithm with the points obtained after epsilon has
	decreased. Indeed, this patch also fixes bug #17200 except for one
	case where, precisely, it is not a good idea to continue the
	algorithm after epsilon has decreased.

2016-09-07  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* Makefile.am: Removed definitions of sollya_C*FLAGS in Makefile.am
	(they seem useless).  Christoph introduced them when we started compiling the interactive
	tool from the library. He could not come with any precise argument
	why he put these definitions, except that he remembers having copied
	it from some more or less official example found on the web.  As far as I understand the logic of automake, this is useless
	because AM_C*FLAGS are automatically added to any target. I tried
	removing it and compiling sollya on a computer where the usual libs
	are installed in some prefix, providing them through the --with-
	mechanism and it worked perfectly.

2016-09-07  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* infnorm.c: Removed code that seems useless.  While investigating the bug addressed by Christoph at commit
	e0b3184, I found a piece of code I could not understand the logic of
	in infnorm.c.  This code adds a complementary test to an existing
	test deciding whether we should run Newton's algorithm within
	dirtyinfnorm algorithm. The addition has been made by Christoph at
	commit 9b1d5e6. This commit performs many non trivial modifications
	on many files, including infnorm.c, but this precise modification is
	completely isolated (in particular, it is the only modification to
	the dirtyinfnorm algorithm). There is no comment that would provide
	us with an idea of the intent behing this modification, and the
	commit log is not more helpful.  I cannot see any logic in this modification, although it is rather
	harmless in the sense that it would simply conclude that it is
	necessary to run Newton's algorithm in situations where it does not
	seem quite useful.  The present commit reverts this modification. All the tests keep
	passing.

2016-09-07  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	* infnorm.c: Trying to patch a strange performance bug in interval
	evaluation with low precision.

2016-09-05  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* tests-tool/check029.sollya: Changed variable names to uppercase in
	the systematic tests for objectname.  This is to clearly separate variable names in the generated script
	from variable names in the generating script. This is made necessary
	by Christoph's change of commit 10f890b that removed a 'restart'
	that would be otherwise required.

2016-09-05  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	* tests-tool/check029.sollya, tests-tool/check029.sollya.reference: 
	Still improving debuggability of a test.

	* external.c, infnorm.h: Updated copyrights.

2016-08-30  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* tests-lib/tget_element_in_list_timecomplexity.c: Made
	tget_element_in_list_timecomplexity test be skipped instead of
	failure Whenever this complexity check does not pass, it returns a code
	meaning SKIP instead of FAIL, so as not to disturb users or Debian
	robots.  This is similar to what is performed in tests-tool with the
	MAYFAIL_TESTS

2016-08-30  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* configure.ac: Attempt to patch configure issue with fplll on
	Cygwin.  The changes introduced at commit ea4ede2 break configure with some
	versions of fplll on Cygwin. Indeed, the option -std=g++11 was now
	systematically added when supported by the compiler, but it turns
	out that the compilation of some older versions of fplll under
	Cygwin raise an error when compiled with this option, although they
	compile fine without the option...  This commit attempts to fix this issue by adding the -std=g++11
	option only when the new API is detected, indicating that fplll is
	recent enough.

2016-08-30  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	* fpminimax.c, general.c, plot.c: Worked around some compiler
	warnings.

	should be used with the old API

2016-08-26  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* Makefile.am, general.c, sollya.h2m, version.h: Minor modifications
	to restore proper behavior of help2man It turns out that an innocent and small modification to Jerome
	Benoit's proposition when merging it back to the trunk at commit
	972f2d6 was completely messing up the work of help2man. This commit
	restores a nice behavior.

2016-08-25  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* tests-tool/check029.sollya, tests-tool/check029.sollya.reference: 
	Added non-regression test for bug #8867

2016-08-02  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* execute.c, implement.c, infnorm.c, infnorm.h, remez.c: (Kind of)
	fixing bug [#8867] Possible infinite loop in Remez This led me to introduce a new argument to uncertifiedInfnorm that
	allows one to store an argmax.  The patch is a patch over a patched algorithm, and all this does not
	really make sense any more. At least, this patch makes both examples
	reported in the bug report terminate. I have no proof of any kind
	that it completely patches the problem.

2016-08-02  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* remez.c: Reworked verbosity levels for some messages of remez
	algorithm.

2016-08-14  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	interworking between read and forking commands like plot extra-safe.

2016-07-27  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* remez.c: Message "function oscillates too much" is displayed at
	most once per remez step.

2016-07-27  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* remez.c, tests-tool/check029.sollya,
	tests-tool/check029.sollya.reference: Fixed a subtle bug in remez When the function was not defined close after the right end-point of
	the domain, the algorithm could fall into a more or less infinite
	loop, trying to evaluate it again and again at points not in the
	domain.  A non regression test was added.

2016-07-13  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* general.c, main.c, sollya-library-wrappers.c: Updated copyrights
	and checked that PDF and PHP are synchonized.

	* doc/Makefile.am: Makes it possible to recompile the doc within a
	VPATH build

	to underscores)

2016-07-13  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* doc/Makefile.am: Added source tex files into the distributed

	* library.c: Removed a warning.

2016-07-12  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* .gitignore: Yet another update of .gitignore For files in tests-lib this time...

2016-07-12  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* general.c, sollya.map, tests-lib/Makefile.am,
	tests-lib/tget_element_in_list.c,
	tests-lib/tget_element_in_list.reference,
	tests-lib/tget_element_in_list_timecomplexity.c,
	tests-lib/tget_element_in_list_timecomplexity.reference: 
	Time-complexity checks in tests-lib independent from Sollya library In order to avoid declaring symbols in sollya.map that are useless
	  except for the checks of the lib, I propose the following patch: - separate tests of tget_element_in_list into two separate files:
	  one file is specifically for checking the time complexity.  - this time check is performed only on systems where gettimeofday is
	available Right now, if gettimeofday is available the test is performed and
	may fail (as opposed to tests-tool/timecheck.sollya that is marked
	as 'SKIP' instead of 'FAIL' when it does not pass).  Normally, the
	check for tget_element_in_list_timecomplexity is designed to be
	really robust and measure a theoretical complexity, so I am in favor
	of really marking it as 'FAIL' in case it does not pass. But notice
	that this behavior is easy to change if we wish.  Normally, I should have removed everything that had been added to
	the source code specifically to make sollya_gettime available and
	usable in the tests of the lib.

2016-07-12  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* Makefile.am, libsollyaexample.c: Removed libsollyaexample.c This file had been created initially to offer a panorama of how to
	used the library but it has never been really filled with something
	non-trivial.  The idea remains good in itself but would require some work.
	Currently, the official documentation does the job and the
	test-lib/*.c files offer a lot of practical examples, more valuable
	than the current libsollyaexample.c

2016-07-12  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* tests-tool/Makefile.am, tests-tool/check.proto: Less fragile
	support for timecheck timecheck is designed to be quite robust, but, by its nature may
	fail on some unusual architectures. This could be misleading to
	people that might think that they have a problem with their
	compilation of Sollya.  An idea proposed by Jerome Benoit was to list it as XFAIL, but
	timecheck *is not* expected to fail: it is expected to pass,
	although, sometimes, it might not pass (notice that these situations
	are worth being reported). As a compromise, I propose in this patch
	simply to mark it as skipped when it does not pass.

2016-07-12  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* Makefile.am, general.c, general.h, main.c, main.h: Started working

2016-07-05  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	* general.c: Reintegrating Jerome's patches for Debian into Sollya
	Master.  There were serveral regressions induced by Jerome's patch, so we
	should run this commit by Jerome to see if he can integrate this
	commit into Debian, too.

2016-07-04  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* xml.c: Minor modif to xml.c so as not to perturb our copyright
	helper script.

2016-07-04  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* libsollyaexample.c: Updated libsollyaexample.c so as to compile.  We should definitely think of the status of this file before next
	release.

2016-07-04  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* Makefile.am: Removed lines that have been commented by Jerome
	Benoit.  If they are useless, there is no need to keep them as a comment.  If
	they turn out to be useful for some reason, we can always revert the
	change.  Also, I did not remove the carriage return introduce by Jerome
	Benoit in Makefile.am before the -version-info flag. I assume he
	introduced it for some reason (maybe to prepare the use of version
	script?). I wonder why he removed $(AM_LDFLAGS) however. I would
	think we introduced it for some reason in the first place. The proof
	of the pudding is in the eating: let us see if we manage to compile
	everywhere without this parameter.

2016-07-04  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* general.c, parser.y, version.h: Corrected an error introduced in
	previous commit.  Contrary to what one could think at first sight, both version
	messages were not perfectly identical. This led to some globbish in
	the displayed message.  Now, both version messages are the same. Also, some indentation
	problem was introduced in previous commit and is now fixed.

	* doc/shlp2txt.sh: Removed support for color in text mode when
	skipping lines of output in examples

2016-05-18  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* doc/shlp2html.sh, doc/shlp2tex.sh, doc/shlp2txt.sh,
	doc/sollya.tex, doc/www/sollyacss.css: Added support for skipping
	lines of output in the examples of shlp files.  In a #EXAMPLE section of a shlp file it is now possible to add a
	comment of the form /* Skip NN */ at the end of a line. The first NN
	lines of the output produced by this specific line will be removed
	and a warning will be displayed explaining that some lines have been
	removed.  This feature is quite fragile because of the constraints imposed by
	the Verbatim environment in LaTeX. It will most probably fail if the
	(non removed part of the) output contains one of the characters '\',
	'~' or '|'.

2016-05-12  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	* library.c: Added missing Sollya keywords to the list in library.c.

	procedures.  Also fixed the "--" bug in the arguments of Sollya interactive tool.  Finally, reverted a useless (and possibly confusing) change of
	Christoph in Table 5 "Testing the type of a Sollya object"

	added only now and not before.

2015-09-16  Christoph Lauter <christoph.lauter@lip6.fr>

	* library.h, sollya-library-wrappers.c, sollya.h: Finished

	* expression.c, infnorm.c, polynomials.c, sollya-messages.h,

	bug [#18992] degree returns -1 instead of the degree without any
	warning.  This commit changes the reference behavior of degree(0/x) to yield
	0, as the reason given at commit
	5029f0ed4e75bdee04c7b979030405e883ea30d2 is no longer true, because
	Sollya is now able to perform such simplifications.

2015-02-13  Sylvain Chevillard <sylvain.chevillard@ens-lyon.org>

	* configure.ac: Corrected kind of a bug in configure when using
	--with-package without argument When --with-package is given to configure without any "=something"
	argument, the value of the argument defaults to "yes" which is
	non-sense in the purpose with which we use the --with-package option
	when configuring Sollya.  Moreover, the extra "-Lyes" produced by configure in this case turns
	out to be a problem at compile time (though not at configure time)
	because libtool seems to be extra careful about it and checks that
	the directory given as argument of "-L" indeed exists.  This commit patch this behavior by simply ignoring the
	--with-package directive when no argument or an empty argument is
	given.

	* tests-tool/check001.sollya.reference: * The patch at revision 2272 did not only fix a bug in the warning
	but also a double-rounding issue that was present from a very long
	time ago.  Irony of history: a test was present in the checks precisely for
	this purpose, but the reference value had not been checked carefully
	enough and was wrong.  So, to sum up: a bug has been fixed @2272 while we were not even
	aware of the presence of the bug. And the fact that the bug has been
	corrected has been detected by failure of routine checks during the
	weekly...  This commit was extracted from SVN r2279.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@2279

	was a bug in the estimation of the precision of a root computed by
	Newton's algorithm.  As a result, I think that the algorithm could
	have oscillate between some value and its successor in the given
	floating-point format, without an end.  I hope that this revision
	also solves this issue, but I am not able to artificially produce
	such an example of oscillation, so I cannot check that my patch
	corrects this issue.  This commit was extracted from SVN r2201.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@2201

	* configure.ac: * Second attempt.  The problem that we try to fix here is that
	adding -lstdc++ in the compilation line does not work when gcc is
	used to link and when gcc version does not agreee with g++ version.
	Also, it might not work if the version of g++ does not agree with
	the version of lstdc++.  We add -lstdc++ to the compilation line only if we are sure that it
	works. Not adding it does no harm in general, as it is only needed
	on Cygwin, with old versions of fplll.  Hopefully (but it is hard to
	  test it in order to be certain), if we are in the unlikely case
	  when: 1) we have an old version of fplll   2) we are on Cygwin   3) we cannot add -lstdc++ to the compilation line, configure will
	detect that sollya cannot be build on this specific machine. What
	makes me optimistic about it is the fact that there is a test after
	all this mess that tries to compile and run a small example program
	using fplll. I think that that test will fail on this particular
	architecture.  This commit was extracted from SVN r2200.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@2200

	* tests-tool/check027.sollya, tests-tool/check027.sollya.reference: * Non-regression tests for bugs #13046 and #16434.  Bug #16434 is
	not completely fixed though, because it still requires to take a
	decision about what Sollya should return when asked for evaluating
	a/b with a and b mathematically equal to 0.  Currently, we return
	[-Inf, Inf] (this is the behavior considered as correct in the newly
	added tests in check027.sollya, for instance). We have always
	considered that [-Inf, Inf] and NaN were approximately as useless,
	so we did not think too much about when we should return one or
	another.  However, for instance sin([-Inf, Inf]) can legitimately
	return [-1, 1], while sin([NaN, NaN]) must return NaN. One means
	'some arbitrary value in the range of sin' while the other means
	'some computation was incorrect'.  We do not change this behavior now, but we might think of this
	problem and change the behavior for a future release.  This commit was extracted from SVN r2178.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@2178

	* remez.c: * Patched a nasty bug in Newton: whenever the iterator of Newton's
	algorithm evaluates to NaN, the next point of the algorithm used to
	be NaN leading to an infinite loop.  This bug is here for a very
	long time, but seems to have been undiscovered until now, because it
	is barely impossible to produce.  We incidentally discovered it two
	revisions ago, because of deep modifications that we made in the
	code used to simplify expressions.  The problem has been detected by
	check012 which felt into an infinite loop.  These modifications have
	been further improved at previous revision, hiding again the bug in
	Newton.  I am unfortunately not able to produce a non-regression
	test in the current state of the repository.  This commit was extracted from SVN r2175.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@2175

	* external.c, plot.c: Reverted change of the previous revision.  The
	patch *is* a bug. Indeed, correcting it is easy: it suffices to
	change "%" into "%%". Moreover, "%g" would sound more appropriate to
	me than "%e" and would be conform to the behavior on the setting by
	default in my version of gnuplot.  @Christoph: can you explain the
	nature of the "displaying error" that you mention? Would "%g" make
	bug recent versions of gnuplot? This commit was extracted from SVN r1857.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1857

	* tests-lib/tdirtyinfnorm.c, tests-lib/tdirtyinfnorm.reference: * Patched a bug in the test of dirtyinfnorm. Since dirtyinfnorm
	perturbs the sampling points (as do remez and plot) it is affected
	by the old bug of mpfr_urandomb and it becomes apparent on one of
	the tests. I apply the same methodology as with remez: I test if one
	of the three expected behaviors appears or not.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1752.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1752

	* mpfi-compat.c: * Patched a bug that has been detected because check021 failed.  The
	bug actually lies inside MPFI 1.5 and has been corrected in the most
	recent versions of MPFI.  However, since MPFI 1.5 is still widely
	distributed (e.g., by Debian), it seems appropriate to patch the
	behavior directly in mpfi-compat.c instead of relying on the patch
	of MPFI.  In consequence, we do not use mpfi_sub_fr anymore but
	reimplement it by ourself. As a consequence, we might (very
	marginally) loose performance.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1750.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1750

	callback before installing another one (in the future, if some day
	uninstalling a callback is really needed before installing a new
	one, in order to avoid memory leaks, then we would have to do it
	ourself by implementing the call to uninstall inside the function
	install).  * Added missing generated help files for chebyshevform to the

	some cosmic reason, they had not been updated when I performed the
	svn merge at previous revision.  * Added check021.sollya.* and updated Makefile.am in directory
	tests-lib. Mioara used to put them in the old 'tests' directory that
	does not exist anymore. As a consequence : the tests do not pass
	currently, because of check021.sollya. I suspect that Mioara always
	thought that her tests passed because her 'make check' was indeed
	not using her files.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1747.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1747

	* infnorm.c: Coded a shortcut in the faithful/ correct rounding loop
	in order to conclude faster on a faithful rounding in some cases.
	However, as the algorithm is coded in a way that prefers correct
	rounding over faithful rounding in all cases when correct rounding
	is sufficiently easy to get, faithfully rounded results will always
	stay rare with respect to correctly rounded ones.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1736.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1736

	function that were no longer in use.  Changed the behavior of evaluateFaithful, making quite a few tests

	as a faithful rounding wherever possible (if the proof interval is
	sufficiently small) and returns the correct rounding to the nearest
	(ties to even) of the midpoint of both possible answers otherwise.  This change in behavior should remove any biais on the rounding
	direction of faithful evaluations.  If this change in behavior does not satisfy the users (and test
	suite), it may be reverted back in the future.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1709.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1709

	* execute.c: Corrected a pretty huge bug found by Sylvain.  The tests don't pass no more as we have to double- and triple-check
	them again.  The original bug message was (sorry for the French): "Voici une session Sollya que je trouve déconcertante : > d = [sin(pi/6)*(1-1b-40)]; Warning: the given expression is not a
	constant but an expression to evaluate. A faithful evaluation will
	be used.  > log2(sup(d)-inf(d)); -40 Bon, j'ai jamais trop bien compris à quel point c'était censé
	être sharp quand on faisait [expr] pour obtenir un encadrement de
	expr.  Cela étant, lorsqu'un warning m'informe qu'une évaluation
	fidèle va être utilisée, je m'attends à ce que la taille de mon
	intervalle à la sortie soit de l'ordre de quelques ulps de la
	précision courante. Donc y a un truc qui déconne là je trouve.  Sylvain" This commit was extracted from SVN r1623.  git-svn-id:

	* sollya.h: * Added forgotten declaration @rev 1370 in sollya.h.  guessDegree
	now takes an integer argument 'bound' which is a stopping criterion
	for the algorithm.  In Sollya, the default value is 1024. In
	practice, the algorithm aborts if it does not achieve to prove that
	the degree you are looking for is smaller than bound.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1461.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1461

	correction of the problem affecting mpfr_urandom (see commit message
	of revision 1270).  As a consequence polynomials computed by remez
	algorithm were different with recent versions of MPFR compared to
	older versions and the tests were broken.  The set of tests should now pass both with old and recent MPFR
	libraries.  A problem might still remain with check012 (it is FPminimax). I have
	to investigate if it is just due to the remez thing or if there is

	* execute.c, fpminimax.cpp, remez.c, remez.h: * Added a sixth optional parameter to remez command. This parameter
	is currently *DEPRECATED* because we do not guarantee to support it
	in the future. The behavior of this sixth parameter may change
	without any warning in the future.  Currently the sixth parameter is an interval [satisfying_err,
	  target_err] with the following behavior: - if, during the algorithm, we manage to prove that target_err is
	  unreachable, we stop the algorithm returning the last computed
	  polynomial.  - if, during the algorithm, we obtain a polynomial with an error
	  smaller than satisfying_err, we stop the algorithm returning that
	  polynomial.  - otherwise we loop until we find an optimal polynomial with the
	required quality, as usual.  The default is [0, +Inf] ('default' keyword is supported).  Examples of use:   [0, +Inf]  -> whatever happens, compute the optimal polynomial
	  with the required quality (same behavior as before).  [target_err]
	                 -> my target error is target_err. If you manage to prove that it is
	                 not reachable stop computing immediately (I do not
	                 care the optimal polynomial: it is worst than what I need anyway).
	                 On the contrary, if you manage to find a polynomial
	  with that error, do not continue further (that one is sufficient for
	  my needs).  [0, target_err] -> I am interested by the optimal
	                 polynomial, except if it is not even able to provide me target_err
	(typically: I absolutely need an error smaller than target_err, but
	                 any extra bit of accuracy would be welcome, so I am interested by
	  the optimal polynomial nonetheless) [satisfying_err, +Inf] -> I am
	                 happy with any polynomial with an error better than satisfying_error
	                 (so, stop the computation as soon as such a
	                 polynomial is found). However, if such a polynomial does not exist,
	                 I would like to use the optimal polynomial
	                 (typically: I have the constraint that I cannot use a degree larger
	                 than a given n. Under this constraint, I would like
	  to achieve satisfying_error, or if not possible, keep my constraint
	  but get the best possible approximation) [target_err/4,
	                 target_err] -> My target error is target_err, so I would like to
	                 immediately stop the computation if it is not
	achievable. Moreover, I need some room (maybe because I will use my
	                 remez polynomial as the input of fpminimax, and this will make me
	                 loose accuracy). So, 2 extra bits are enough (do not compute further
	                 if you already have the two extra bits), and if
	this goal is not achievable, give me the closest to my 2 extra bits
	(i.e. the optimal polynomial).  This commit was extracted from SVN r1405.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1405

	default on the concat operator ("@") and on bounds of ranges ("match
	[1;2] with [default;2] : (1);") Corrected a possible bug in bashevaluate if ever the pipe from the
	child process that gets forked off to run the bash command gets
	closed once before the child process ends, then filled up again and
	is eventually closed after child process ends.  Recompiled the PDF documentation from the sources as it was not
	up-to-date.  Added additional test lines in the check files and in the memoryleak
	check files to test the behavior on default described above.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1388.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1388

	* doc/help.php, doc/infnorm.shlp, doc/shlp2html.sh, doc/sollya.php: * Removed warning errors signaled by the W3C validator.  Some of
	them were minor, other were more important. Here is a summary.  * In sollya.php: some </li> without <li>. They came from the fact
	that large parts of sollya.php have been auto-generated from
	sollya.tex and not carefully re-read.  * In sollya.php: missing <p> at some places.  * In sollya.php: links in php were of the form
	help.php?field1=foo&field2=bar instead of
	help.php?field1=foo&amp;field2=bar.  I was just not aware of this
	subtility.  * In the html code produced by shlp2html: there remained many '<'
	and '>' that should normally have been protected as &lt; and &gt;
	This was a fairly big issue in my opinion, and I am even surprised
	that the HTML has been correctly rendered by Iceweasel.  Correcting
	this made me modify things in shlp2html.sh. Hope I did not break
	anything (I checked and it seems not, but I can have missed
	something).  * Corrected a typo in the way infnorm.shlp was formatted, that
	prevented shlp2html.sh to correctly generate items.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1282.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1282

	* tests/check.sollya, tests/check.sollya.output,
	tests/checkSupnorm.sollya: * Due to a bug in MPFR, mpfr_urandom used to give different results
	on 32-bit and 64-bit computers.  Since remez perturbs the initial
	points in order to avoid undesirable regularity effects, this bug
	has an influence on the result of the remez command. The result is
	fine in any case, but not bit-per-bit the same on all computers.
	This was detected by make check. As a matter of fact, we do not
	claim to have totally reproductible results on every platform; we
	only claim to give correct results (i.e. with an error bounded by
	what the user has asked for).  However, the reproductibility is
	desirable, e.g. because it eases debugging. Hence, we find desirable
	that make check detects whenever Sollya has a platform-dependent
	behavior.  In this revision, I patched check.sollya in order to make it pass,
	despite the bug. But I also added a test that checks that we have
	one of the three expected behavior: either with a 32-bit
	architecture with an old MPFR, or with a 64-bit architecture with an
	old MPFR, or any architecture with a recent version (i.e. today, a
	SVN one) of MPFR.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1270.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1270

	* implement-cste.c: Corrected a bug in add/sub: there was subtle bug
	in my proof when the sufficient precision for the intermediate
	results was negative.  Probably, this had no influence on the code since the negative
	precision was replaced by MPFR_PREC_MIN anyway.  But it was safer to
	have a code corresponding to the proof. Moreover, the patch is an
	interesting optimization: if the sufficient precision is negative,
	we can avoid computing the corresponding expression: "(some
	complicated expr)+exp(100)" can be simplified to "exp(100)" up to a
	fairly big precision: there is no need to evaluate the complicated
	expr in precision MPFR_PREC_MIN as we did before.  Interestingly, this led me to implement the if-then-else
	instruction: it is possible to write formal programs containing
	branches. I also added a formal indentation mechanism for correctly
	displaying embedded blocks.  The code seems to be correct and no memory leak was observed. I did
	not perform intensive tests though.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1108.  git-svn-id:

	* doc/libraryconstantexample.c, implement-cste.c: Corrected a bug in
	the addition/subtraction case in implementconstant.  The bug
	possibly affected any addition/subtraction; however, it was
	particularly visible when the result of the addition was an exact
	zero.  Now, implementconstant complains (and aborts) whenever a
	subexpression is exactly zero at a place where we cannot handle it.
	WARNING: currently, this is very dirty, we raise an exception
	without freeing anything.  Also added an example for libraryconstant (forgot from a previous
	commit).  This commit was extracted from SVN r1107.  git-svn-id:

	* execute.c: First implementation of the mul/div case. It is still

	functions.  Several minor updates such as numbering the temporary variables.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1068.  git-svn-id:

	* fpminimax.cpp: Patched the second bug mentioned in bug report
	#10073.  This is not completely satisfying though, since fplll will
	use a non-GNU version of malloc and realloc in some cases.  However,
	taken into account what mess libfplll is, the patch can be
	considered as quite good.  This commit was extracted from SVN r1020.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@1020

	* infnorm.c: Reverted a modification by Christoph which introduced a
	possible bug when computing ||f|| where f is almost constant.  This
	a is a short-term patch, while we are thinkning of a way of dealing
	with examples such as: f = log(x)/log(2) - log10(x)/log10(2) + 3; dirtyinfnorm(f,[1;2]); I also corrected a small mistake: there is no need to run Newton's
	algorithm where either f'(x1) or f'(x3)=0 since it means that either
	x1 or x3 is the local extremum. These points are tken into account
	anyway.  This commit was extracted from SVN r876.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@876

	* infnorm.c, remez.c, tests/check.sollya, tests/check.sollya.output: * This is an attempt to patch bug #8330 about the accuracy of
	dirtyinfnorm.  I propose a new implementation of uncertifiedInfnorm.
	This implementation does mainly the same as before but avoid
	evaluating the derivative of f as much as possible.  It uses
	evaluateFaithfulWithCutOffFast and my implementation of Newton's
	algorithm.  * I made some modifications to evaluateFaithfulWithCutOffFast:
	startprec is now really used as the initial precision. This code
	should be read carefully by someone else than me since it is a
	critical code for Sollya. However, the tests of check.sollya all
	pass.  * I modified check.sollya: I corrected some syntax errors and added

	* infnorm.c, remez.c, tests/check.sollya, tests/check.sollya.output: * Patched Newton's algorithm: except if there is a bug in the patch,
	the algorithm should be more stable now.  In particular, there was a
	bug when searching for the zero of f in [a,b] where a<0<b and f(0) =
	NaN. This bug is now solved.  This bug had been introduced in
	revision 783 and was observed for instance when calling
	remez((2^x-1)/x,9,[-1/16,1/16]) that had become very slow due to the
	bug.  Christoph also observed the bug when trying to improve
	dirtyinform.  * I added a new possible returned value to
	evaluateFaithfulWithCutOffFast. In fact, I used to believe that 0
	was returned if and only if the algorithm was unable to find a
	precision guaranteeing the faithful rounding. It appears that 0 was
	also returned when the algorithm does not manage to evaluate the
	expression into a real number (e.g. it evaluates to Inf or NaN).
	Now, evaluateFaithfulWithcutOffFast returns 3 in this case. This
	allows one to see the difference between a problem of accuracy (i.e.
	f(x) is too small) and a problem of evaluation (i.e. f(x) is not
	defined or has a false singularity that cannot be detected).  I
	modified every functions that use the returned value of
	evaluateFaithfulWithCutOffFast, in order to keep the compatibility.  * I added a test case for remez((2^x-1)/x,9,[-1/16,1/16]) in
	check.sollya I also numbered the test cases because it was really a
	mess to find out where a problem came from when somthing changed in
	check.sollya.output.  I also discovered some bugs in check.sollya
	(syntax errors) that I corrected.  Finally, the test case number 171
	invoked 'quit' which prevented to run the following tests. I guess
	it was a mistake, so I commented it. If it was intended, please
	uncomment it, but put this test case as the last one.  This commit was extracted from SVN r866.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@866

	* double.c, execute.c, expression.c, general.c, tests/check.sollya,
	tests/check.sollya.output: (1) Corrected a bug in reproducibility of the displaying of values: For precisions prec set between 32 and 64, integer values between
	2^31 and 2^63-1 were displayed differently on machines for which
	sizeof(int) = 8 than for those for which sizeof(int) = 16.  (2) Degraded 4 warnings on D, DD, TD, DE "Warning: rounding a value computed on less than 53 bits to double
	precision." to an information.  (3) Changed the behaviour of the tool on automatic printing (on the
	prompt) if no faithful rounding can be determined for a constant
	expression.  For constant expressions f(c) for which it can be proved that it
	exists two reals (not including infinity) a and b such that a <= f(c) <= b and a * b < 0, 0 is displayed instead of some FP-determined value if
	no faithful rounding for f(c) can be determined.  The warning texts have significantly been changed, hence an update
	of the check files.  The change might involve issue with backward compatibility.  ATTENTION: The help text and documentation files have not been updated yet.  THIS MUST BE DONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  (4) Corrected a bug concerning rationalmode. The value of that global
	constant did not get reset to its default value on restart.  This commit was extracted from SVN r809.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@809

	* double.c, tests/check.sollya, tests/check.sollya.output: Second
	and hopefully final version of the patch for bug #7085 Rounding to
	simplie value with infinity overflow is wrong.  The bug (and several bugs hidden by the bug [un bogue peut en cacher
	un autre]) was due to double rounding issues. The double roundings
	either occurred because of: - a first rounding to double precision or - a rounding to 24 bits with unbounded exponent range or - a rounding to 24 bits with unbounded exponent range followed by a
	rounding to double precision followed by a rounding to single
	precision.  Everthing's should be fine now.  This commit was extracted from SVN r800.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@800

	* README, fpminimax.cpp: Fpminimax exhibitted an infinite loop in a
	particular case.  When the coefficients are floating-point numbers,
	the algorithm has to guess the exponents of the coefficients first.
	Then, fpminimax is launched and we check afterwards that the
	coefficients have the same exponent as we guessed.  If it is not the
	case, we correct the exponents and loop.  I knew that it could lead theoretically to an infinite loop. Yet, it
	was never oberved in practice.  Mioara found the following instance
	that effectively leads to an infinite loop: f=sqrt(x); d=[1+12/512,
	1+13/512];  fpminimax(f, 2, [|18, 10, 14|], d); It turns out that the algorithm loops over the two polynomials
	p=-1.00100001000101_2 * 2^(-3) * x^2 + 1.10010001_2  * 2^(-1) * x +
	1.0110111010000111_2  * 2^(-2) q=-1.100110000101_2  *  2^(-4) * x^2
	+ 1.011001011_2 * 2^(-1) * x + 1.10011011000101111_2 * 2^(-2) Surprinsingly, the coefficients of x^2 is not the same at all in
	both polynomials.  I patched the algorithm with the following trick: when more than
	MAXLOOP trials have been performed, we stop as soon as a polynomial
	fits in the formats.  This still ensures that the result of the
	algorithm has the good form. This avoids the previous infinite loop
	but the theoretical possibility of an infinite loop stays.  This commit was extracted from SVN r786.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@786

	* remez.c: When there is too many oscillations, the algorithm should
	use the exchange algorithm. In the particular case when the
	algorithm did not use the slower algorithm, this error was caught at
	the end by a call to dirtyinfnorm but nothing was done to solve the
	problem. Now, the main loop is relaunched forcing an exchange step.
	Hopefully, this will introduce the maximum and converge. The
	convergence should not be taken for sure.  This commit was extracted from SVN r651.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@651

	* remez.c: MAJOR MODIFICATION: this is a first try to integrate the
	exchange algorithm into the current implementation of remez command.
	Since it merges two different algorithms (second algorithm and
	exchange algorithm) into a single program, I am completely unsure of
	the stability of this new implementation.  However, the new
	implementation should always give a correct minimax when it finishes
	normally. In the case when the Haar condition is fulfilled, the
	algorithm should be at most twice slower than the old
	implementation.  This is provided as a temporary and experimental implementation
	before a safer and faster one in the next few weeks.  This commit was extracted from SVN r589.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@589

	* expression.c, expression.h, lexer.lex, main.c, main.h, parser.y: 
	Added lexing and parsing capability for GP/PARI scientific notation:
	1.24     (spaces)E+2 Attention: no spaces are permitted for cases where no exponent (e/E)
	is given. If the exponent sign (e/E) is given, the exponent value
	becomes obligatory. The feature is *not* available for dyadic
	notation: 1232b-5 is correct 1234 b-5 is not.  Added write command to user interface: the same as print but no
	spaces or newlines are added. Special syntax for writing/ appending
	to a file is available: write 1, 2;              -> prints 12 on stdout write > "toto" 1, 2
	-> prints 12 in file "toto", erasing an old file "toto" write >>
	"toto" 1, 2     -> prints 12 in file "toto", appending to its
	content.  Attention: on writing to files, strings to print a first created in
	memory and then printed. High memory usage may follow.  Added trailing zero removal in scientific notation output.  This commit was extracted from SVN r241.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@241

	* implement.c, implement.h, infnorm.c, lexer.lex, parser.y: Improved
	implementpoly. Coefficient precisions are now rounded automatically
	by default. An option (honorcoeffprec) allows to get no rounding on
	the coefficients.  It is now possible to get the implemented
	polynomial back using p = <implementpoly ...> There is an additional
	check that the additions in the Horner steps do not cancellate.  This commit was extracted from SVN r101.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@101

	* infnorm.c, infnorm.h, lexer.lex, main.c, main.h, makefile,

	function by interval arithmetic. The corresponding command is: checkinfnorm <function> in <range> bounded by <constant expression>
	[, diam = <diameter>]; Highly improved the quality of Taylor interval evaluations and thus
	improved the quality of the certified infinite norm by allowing the
	Taylor evaluation to recurse on the linear term up to a certain
	level. The default level is 0, so by default, nothing changes. The
	command for setting the recursion level is taylorrecursions = <positive or zero integer>; This commit was extracted from SVN r96.  git-svn-id: svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/sollya/trunk@96
