This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an
environment for safe floating-point code development. It is
particularily targeted to the automatized implementation of
mathematical floating-point libraries (libm). Amongst other features,
it offers a certified infinity norm, an automatic polynomial
implementer and a fast Remez algorithm.

that may mean  that it is complicated to manipulate,  and  that  also
therefore means  that it is reserved for developers  and  experienced
professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore

/* Compute a Chebyshev form of order n for f over dom 
   
   Make a base change such that Ch + sum errors_i * x^i + delta is an
   absolute-error Taylor form for f over dom, developed at a point in
   the middle of dom.
   
   Return the original Chebyshev coefficients (in the Chebyshev basis)
   as chebyshevCoefficients.

   Upon entry, delta has already been initialized with sollya_mpfi_init2.
   The (sollya_mpfi_t *) intervals in errors and chebyshevCoefficients 
   must be allocated (safeMalloc'ed) and initialized with sollya_mpfi_init2.

   The entries in errors and chebyshevCoefficients are in natural order,
   i.e. errors->value points to the 0-th (constant) radius interval
   around the 0-th (constant) coefficient in Ch.

   An error during computation can be signaled by setting Ch to NULL.
   In this case, no memory must be left allocated by the function 
   upon return.

   All computations should be performed using prec as working precision
   (try to refrain from using getToolsPrecision()).
