min(4,5,1,3) returns 1
min([|4, 5, 1, 3|]) returns 1
Warning: the tool is unable to decide a minimum computation by evaluation even though faithful evaluation of the terms has been possible. The terms will be considered to be equal.
min of 17 + log2(13)/log2(9) and 17 + log(13)/log(9) returns 17 + log(13) / log(9)
Warning: the tool is unable to decide a minimum computation by evaluation even though faithful evaluation of the terms has been possible. The terms will be considered to be equal.

min([|1, @NaN@, 2|]) returns 1
min of 17 returns 17
