max(4,5,1,3) returns 5
max([|4, 5, 1, 3|]) returns 5
Warning: the tool is unable to decide a maximum computation by evaluation even though faithful evaluation of the terms has been possible. The terms will be considered to be equal.
max of 17 + log2(13)/log2(9) and 17 + log(13)/log(9) returns 17 + log2(13) / log2(9)
Warning: the tool is unable to decide a maximum computation by evaluation even though faithful evaluation of the terms has been possible. The terms will be considered to be equal.
max([|17 + log2(13) / log2(9), 17 + log(13) / log(9)|]) returns 17 + log2(13) / log2(9)

max([|2, @NaN@, 1|]) returns 2
max(1,NaN,2) returns 2
max([|@NaN@, 1, 2|]) returns 2
max of 17 returns 17
max([|17|]) returns 17
