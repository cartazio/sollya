Before even thinking of performing the release:
  * Close bugs that can be closed.
  * Check that all modifications have been reported in the documenation.
  * Check that all new feature has a library version if needed and has a shlp if needed (with a #LIBRARYNAME if needed) and an entry in the 'help help' list.
  * Compile with verbose options and check that no warning remains.

When the release seems ready:
  * Check that 'make check' passes on several architectures (especially cygwin).
  * Check that all modifications to sollya.tex have been reported into sollya.php.
  * valgrind everything.
  * Recompile the doc.
  * Check that the version number of Sollya is correctly set.
  * Check that copyrights and email addresses are up to date.
  * Generate the Changelog file, and the human-readable NEWS file.
  * Build the release. Try to install it and test it on several architectures (especially cygwin).
  * Put it online and make announcements.
  * Create an entry in history.php for the new release.
