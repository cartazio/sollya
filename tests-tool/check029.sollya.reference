    The Sollya software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide
    an environment for safe floating-point code development. It is
    particularily targeted to the automatized implementation of
    mathematical floating-point libraries (libm). Amongst other features,
    it offers a certified infinity norm, an automatic polynomial
    implementer and a fast Remez algorithm.
