Warning: Rounding occurred when converting the constant "4097.1" to floating-poi
nt with 300 bits.
If safe computation is needed, try to increase the precision.

Warning: Rounding occurred when converting the constant "4097.1" to floating-poi
nt with 12 bits.
The inclusion property is nevertheless satisfied.

Warning: at least one of the given expressions is not a constant but requires ev
aluation.
Evaluation is guaranteed to ensure the inclusion property. The approximate resul
t is at least 30 bit accurate.
